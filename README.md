# pandora

> A personal knowledge management system for custom extension
> of CommonMarkdown. 

This is like a metaframework of some sort. Doesn't do the the work in full.
Adheres UNIX philosophy partially, i.e. to do one work and do it well.

Features(WIP):

  - links between pages
  - ability to include other files content
  - export a website
  - searching the knowledge base

I intend to create these features as I progress, nevertheless the main goal
is to learn rust. So I decided I would create an interpreter of some sort.

`pandora` takes in a directory of `*.md` files and then convert then to a 
website. During the process, it **parses** few custom extensions and convert
them to CommonMark specification.

Later on, files are exported using `Pandoc`. Extension are meant to be a
quick getaway from cumbersome, agonizing typing.
